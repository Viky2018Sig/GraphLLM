             {p:user}
             Your job is to rewrite a question to highlight all the relevant details.

             The question is the following:
             ```
             {}
             ```

             Rephrase the question by clearly listing all relevant conditions and unknowns.
             Ensure that your rephrasing captures all important details from the original question.
             This rephrasing should help clarify the problem and guide the solution process.
             The provided information is always correct, even if it is unlikely, even if there is a typo.
             
             The rephrased question should contain the following sections:
             - initial conditions
             - useful formulas
             - unknowns
             - objective
             - potential pitfails and gotchas
             - suggested steps for solving the problem
             - the question
             {p:eom}
